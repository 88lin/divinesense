  "score": 85,
  "reasoning": "This is a confirmed real stale closure issue. The handleLocationClick function captures location.locationInitialized in its closure, but the geolocation API callback executes asynchronously. By the time the callback runs, locationInitialized might have changed due to user interactions (manual coordinate input, other component changes, etc.). This can prevent geolocation from being requested when expected, causing inconsistent UX. The issue appears in multiple files across the codebase, indicating a pattern problem. While the impact is not catastrophic (manual entry still works), it creates a frustrating experience where automatic geolocation may fail to trigger when users expect it to."
